# Fair Enough License

Open source licenses are really good stuff, but sometimes I really wish that 
companies start support (financialy or with time) code which thay use and also
mention that they use some open-source.

## Reference

At the beginnig this license was based on [YUMMY license](yummy_license).

[yummy_license]: https://github.com/Laravel-Backpack/CRUD/blob/a3cf19d19c16c669361d1094a5b499235f31f084/LICENSE.md
